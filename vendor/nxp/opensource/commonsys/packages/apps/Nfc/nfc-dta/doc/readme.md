The ReadMe explains about waht DTA build varients will be build by default and
what changes needed to build DTA for other than default varients.

1) By default the DTA build for SNxyz varients with Android-10 / 11.

2) By default the DTA build with vendor.nxp.nxpnfc@v2.0. For MW which supports
   vendor.nxp.nxpnfclegacy@v1.0 & vendor.nxp.nxpnfc@v1.1 need to build with the
corresponding vendor versions.
