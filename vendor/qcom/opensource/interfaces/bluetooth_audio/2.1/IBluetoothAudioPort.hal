 * HAL interface from the Audio HAL to the Bluetooth stack
 *
 * The Audio HAL calls methods in this interface to start, suspend, and stop
 * an audio stream. These calls return immediately and the results, if any,
 * are sent over the IBluetoothAudioProvider interface.
 *
 * Moreover, the Audio HAL can also get the presentation position of the stream
 * and provide stream metadata.
 *
 * Note: For HIDL APIs with a "generates" statement, the callback parameter used
 * for return value must be invoked synchronously before the API call returns.
