Bluedroid LE Test Application
==========================
The test application provides a small console shell interface that allows
access to the Bluetooth HAL API library though ASCII commands. This is similar
to how the real JNI service would operate. The primary objective of this
application is to allow Bluetooth to be put in DUT Mode for RF/BB BQB test purposes.

This application is mutually exclusive with the Java based Bluetooth.apk. Hence
before launching the application, it should be ensured that the Settings->Bluetooth is OFF.

This application is built as 'bdt' and shall be available in '/system/bin/bdt'

Limitations
===========
1.) Settings->Bluetooth must be OFF for this application to work
2.) Currently, only the SIG 'HCI Test Mode' commands are supported. The vendor
specific HCI test mode commands to be added.
