    The wizard:uris recorded here have the inconvenience of being generated by hand, but they allow
    for the full spread of launch flags (we need FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK [0x10000000]), where the
    <intent> tag processed by Intent.parseIntent() does not.

    The wizard action added wizard:ifLifecycle="default" will only be launched during initial setup.
    It will be skipped during deferred setup. Conversely, if the action defined
    wizard:ifLifecycle="deferred", it will only be launched during deferred setup.
