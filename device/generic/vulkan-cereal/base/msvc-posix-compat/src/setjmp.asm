  ;; According to msdn:
  ;;
  ;; A call to setjmp preserves the current stack pointer, non-volatile registers, and
  ;; MxCsr registers. Calls to longjmp return to the most recent setjmp call site and
  ;; resets the stack pointer, non-volatile registers, and MxCsr registers,
  ;; back to the state as preserved by the most recent setjmp call.
  ;;
  ;; We are only doing the bare minimum, and are not saving th mxcsr/xmm/ymm regs.
  ;; We rely on jmp_buf having enough space for 16 64 bit registers.
