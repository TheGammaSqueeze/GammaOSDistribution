// transfers from guest to host.

// See docs/GOLDFISH-VIRTUAL-HARDWARE.txt and
//     docs/ANDROID-QEMU-PIPE.txt
//
// for more details.
// Host / virtual device interface:

// add_buffer():
// Tell us that there is a physically-contiguous buffer in the guest
// starting at |guest_paddr|. This should be used upon allocation
// of the DMA buffer in the ugest.

// remove_buffer():
// Tell us that we don't care about tracking this buffer anymore.
// This should usually be used when the DMA buffer has been freed
// in the ugest.

// Obtain a pointer to guest physical memory that is usable as
// as host void*.

// the guest DMA buffers so to regain access to them.
// This function tells our map of DMA buffers to remap the buffers
// next time they are used.
