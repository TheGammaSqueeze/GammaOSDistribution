# TODO(b/65201432): Switch into enforcing mode once execmem issue due to OpenGL is resolved. Also
# remove the corresponding dontaudit.
# The current (at the time of writing) implementation of OpenGL needs to create executable memory.
# Unfortunately, we cannot grant execmem power using an allow rule because global policy
# (system/sepolicy) contains a corresponding neverallow which would cause build-time errors if the
# allow execmem rule were added here.
