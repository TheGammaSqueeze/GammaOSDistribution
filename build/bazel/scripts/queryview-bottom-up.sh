# queryview-bottom-up.sh: A query script to strategize the bottom-up migration
# approach of any target in the queryview workspace.
#
# Usage: ./queryview-bottom-up.sh <label of target in queryview>
#
# You can generate the queryview workspace using "m queryview". Note that the
# queryview targets represent the fully configured build graph of Soong, so the
# results may differ based on the product configuration and environment which
# the queryview workspace was created in.
#
# This script obtains the transitive closure of a target, sorts its dependencies
# based on minrank (shortest path from root to dep), and gets their module type.
# This can help to figure out the exact module types we need to work on
# converting first,
#
# This script produces the following (a sample):
