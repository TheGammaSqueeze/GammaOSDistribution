 * An opaque type representing a handle to a performance hint session.
 * A session can only be acquired from a {@link APerformanceHintManager}
 * with {@link APerformanceHint_getPreferredUpdateRateNanos}. It must be
 * freed with {@link APerformanceHint_closeSession} after use.
 *
 * A Session represents a group of threads with an inter-related workload such that hints for
 * their performance should be considered as a unit. The threads in a given session should be
 * long-life and not created or destroyed dynamically.
 *
 * <p>Each session is expected to have a periodic workload with a target duration for each
 * cycle. The cycle duration is likely greater than the target work duration to allow other
 * parts of the pipeline to run within the available budget. For example, a renderer thread may
 * work at 60hz in order to produce frames at the display's frame but have a target work
 * duration of only 6ms.</p>
 *
 * <p>After each cycle of work, the client is expected to use
 * {@link APerformanceHint_reportActualWorkDuration} to report the actual time taken to
 * complete.</p>
 *
 * <p>To use:<ul>
 *    <li>Update a sessions target duration for each cycle of work
 *        with  {@link APerformanceHint_updateTargetWorkDuration}.</li>
 *    <li>Report the actual duration for the last cycle of work with
 *        {@link APerformanceHint_reportActualWorkDuration}.</li>
