    /**
     * ReadHead is an object that helps users of ArrayTrackRecord keep track of how far
     * it has read this far in the ArrayTrackRecord. A ReadHead is always associated with
     * a single instance of ArrayTrackRecord. Multiple ReadHeads can be created and used
     * on the same instance of ArrayTrackRecord concurrently, and the ArrayTrackRecord
     * instance can also be used concurrently. ReadHead maintains the current index that is
     * the next to be read, and calls this the "mark".
     *
     * In a ReadHead, {@link poll(Long, (E) -> Boolean)} works similarly to a LinkedBlockingQueue.
     * It can be called repeatedly and will return the elements as they arrive.
     *
     * Intended usage looks something like this :
     * val TrackRecord<MyObject> record = ArrayTrackRecord().newReadHead()
     * Thread().start {
     *   // do stuff
     *   record.add(something)
     *   // do stuff
     * }
     *
     * val obj1 = record.poll(timeout)
     * // do something with obj1
     * val obj2 = record.poll(timeout)
     * // do something with obj2
     *
     * The point is that the caller does not have to track the mark like it would have to if
     * it was using ArrayTrackRecord directly.
     *
     * Thread safety :
     * A ReadHead delegates all TrackRecord methods to its associated ArrayTrackRecord, and
     * inherits its thread-safe properties for all the TrackRecord methods.
     *
     * Poll() operates under its own set of rules that only allow execution on multiple threads
     * within constrained boundaries, and never concurrently or pseudo-concurrently. This is
     * because concurrent calls to poll() fundamentally do not make sense. poll() will move
     * the mark according to what events remained to be read by this read head, and therefore
     * if multiple threads were calling poll() concurrently on the same ReadHead, what
     * happens to the mark and the return values could not be useful because there is no way to
     * provide either a guarantee not to skip objects nor a guarantee about the mark position at
     * the exit of poll(). This is even more true in the presence of a predicate to filter
     * returned elements, because one thread might be filtering out the events the other is
     * interested in. For this reason, this class will fail-fast if any concurrent access is
     * detected with ConcurrentAccessException.
     * It is possible to use poll() on different threads as long as the following can be
     * guaranteed : one thread must call poll() for the last time, then execute a write barrier,
     * then the other thread must execute a read barrier before calling poll() for the first time.
     * This allows in particular to call poll in @Before and @After methods in JUnit unit tests,
     * because JUnit will enforce those barriers by creating the testing thread after executing
     * @Before and joining the thread after executing @After.
     *
     * peek() can be used by multiple threads concurrently, but only if no thread is calling
     * poll() outside of the boundaries above. For simplicity, it can be considered that peek()
     * is safe to call only when poll() is safe to call.
     *
     * Polling concurrently from the same ArrayTrackRecord is supported by creating multiple
     * ReadHeads on the same instance of ArrayTrackRecord (or of course by using ArrayTrackRecord
     * directly). Each ReadHead is then guaranteed to see all events always and
     * guarantees are made on the value of the mark upon return. {@see poll(Long, (E) -> Boolean)}
     * for details. Be careful to create each ReadHead on the thread it is meant to be used on, or
     * to have a clear synchronization point between creation and use.
     *
     * Users of a ReadHead can ask for the current position of the mark at any time, on a thread
     * where it's safe to call peek(). This mark can be used later to replay the history of events
     * either on this ReadHead, on the associated ArrayTrackRecord or on another ReadHead
     * associated with the same ArrayTrackRecord. It might look like this in the reader thread :
     *
     * val markAtStart = record.mark
     * // Start processing interesting events
     * while (val element = record.poll(timeout) { it.isInteresting() }) {
     *   // Do something with element
     * }
     * // Look for stuff that happened while searching for interesting events
     * val firstElementReceived = record.getOrNull(markAtStart)
     * val firstSpecialElement = record.getOrNull(markAtStart) { it.isSpecial() }
     * // Get the first special element since markAtStart, possibly blocking until one is available
     * val specialElement = record.poll(timeout, markAtStart) { it.isSpecial() }
