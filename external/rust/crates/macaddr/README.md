This crate provides types for a [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)
identifiers, both in IEEE *EUI-48* and *EUI-64* formats.

It is like a [`std::net::SocketAddr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.SocketAddr.html) enum with a
[`std::net::SocketAddrV4`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.SocketAddrV4.html) and
[`std::net::SocketAddrV6`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.SocketAddrV6.html) members,
but for MAC addresses instead.

Obviously, MAC address can be represented as a `[u8; 6]` or `[u8; 8]`,
but it is error-prone and inconvenient, so here they are â€”
[MacAddr6](https://docs.rs/macaddr/latest/macaddr/struct.MacAddr6.html) and
[MacAddr8](https://docs.rs/macaddr/latest/macaddr/struct.MacAddr8.html)
structs with helpful methods and standard Rust traits implementations,
intended to be the first-class Rust objects.

And it is `serde`- and `no_std`-friendly also!

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
macaddr = "1.0"
```

## Usage

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/macaddr) for each type
available, all of them have a plenty of examples.
