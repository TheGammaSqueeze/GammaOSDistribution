package {
    default_applicable_licenses: ["external_rust_crates_half_license"],
}

// Added automatically by a large-scale-change that took the approach of
// 'apply every license found to every target'. While this makes sure we respect
// every license restriction, it may not be entirely correct.
//
// e.g. GPL in an MIT project might only apply to the contrib/ directory.
//
// Please consider splitting the single license below into multiple licenses,
// taking care not to lose any license_kind information, and overriding the
// default license using the 'licenses: [...]' property on targets as needed.
//
// For unused files, consider creating a 'fileGroup' with "//visibility:private"
// to attach the license to, and including a comment whether the files may be
// used in the current project.
//
// large-scale-change included anything that looked like it might be a license
// text as a license_text. e.g. LICENSE, NOTICE, COPYING etc.
//
// Please consider removing redundant or irrelevant files from 'license_text:'.
// See: http://go/android-license-faq
