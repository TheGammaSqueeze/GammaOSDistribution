This package is imported to Android and uses Android's external/sqlite
header files and compilation flags to generate bindings.

If features are changed for the libsqlite3-sys crate, please ensure those
features are changed in the sqlite_bindgen_build module.

If you update libsqlite3-sys, check its build.rs against the one at
android/build.rs to ensure it is updated if needed.
