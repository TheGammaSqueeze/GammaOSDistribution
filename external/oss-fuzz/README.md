# OSS-Fuzz: Continuous Fuzzing for Open Source Software

[Fuzz testing] is a well-known technique for uncovering programming errors in
software. Many of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow], can have
serious security implications. Google has found [thousands] of security
vulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of
Chrome components], and we now want to share that service with the open source
community.

In cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative] and the [OpenSSF],
OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by
combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable, distributed execution.

[Core Infrastructure Initiative]: https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/
[OpenSSF]: https://www.openssf.org/

We support the [libFuzzer], [AFL++], and [Honggfuzz] fuzzing engines in
combination with [Sanitizers], as well as [ClusterFuzz], a distributed fuzzer
execution environment and reporting tool.

[libFuzzer]: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html
[AFL++]: https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus
[Honggfuzz]: https://github.com/google/honggfuzz
[Sanitizers]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers
[ClusterFuzz]: https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz

Currently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM code. Other languages
supported by [LLVM] may work too. OSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing x86_64 and i386
builds.
