  This script is used to kick off the Github Actions CI tool. It is the
  entrypoint of the Dockerfile in this directory. This action can be added to
  any OSS-Fuzz project's workflow that uses Github.

  Note: The resulting clusterfuzz binaries of this build are placed in
  the directory: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/out

  Required environment variables:
    OSS_FUZZ_PROJECT_NAME: The name of OSS-Fuzz project.
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY: The name of the Github repo that called this script.
    GITHUB_SHA: The commit SHA that triggered this script.
    GITHUB_EVENT_NAME: The name of the hook event that triggered this script.
    GITHUB_EVENT_PATH:
      The path to the file containing the POST payload of the webhook:
      https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#filesystems-on-github-hosted-runners
    GITHUB_WORKSPACE: The shared volume directory where input artifacts are.
    DRY_RUN: If true, no failures will surface.
    SANITIZER: The sanitizer to use when running fuzzers.

  Returns:
    0 on success or 1 on failure.
