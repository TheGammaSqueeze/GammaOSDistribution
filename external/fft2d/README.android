         Third-party FFT (fast Fourier transform) code

This directory contains the third-party one- and two-dimensional
fast Fourier transform and related sinusoidal transform code written
by Takuya Ooura.

Depending on your needs, there may be better choices than this
package, e.g.:

1.  David Talkin has written a fast and flexible radix-2 FFT class:
      google3/speech/dsp/fft.h

2. fftw (http://www.fftw.org/) likely offers speed advantages over the
routines in this package and undoubtedly has a much larger user base.
However, it's a much bigger and more complex package.
