# Run `rustfmt` on all Rust code contained in crosvm. This is different from

# Crosvm consists of multiple workspaces.
#
# Usage:
#
#    $ bin/fmt
#
# To print a diff and exit 1 if code is not formatted, but without changing any
# files, use:
#
#    $ bin/fmt --check
#

set -euo pipefail

# Change into directory of script, which is crosvm/bin.
cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"

# Jump up to root directory of crosvm repo.
