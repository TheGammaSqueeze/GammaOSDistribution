# "pathlib2" and "scandir" are backports of new standard modules,  pyfakefs will
# use them if available when running on older Python versions.
#
# They are dependencies of pytest when Python < 3.6 so we sometimes get them via
# requirements.txt, this file makes them explicit dependencies for testing &
# development.
#
# Older versions might work ok, the versions chosen here are just the latest
# available at the time of writing.
