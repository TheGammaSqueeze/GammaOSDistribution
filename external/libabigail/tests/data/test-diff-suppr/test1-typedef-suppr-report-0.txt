2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'function void bar(b_type*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'b_type*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct b_type':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'char m_char', at offset 0 (in bits)
        1 data member change:
          'int m_int' offset changed from 0 to 32 (in bits) (by +32 bits)

  [C] 'function void foo(a_type*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'a_type*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'typedef a_type':
        underlying type 'struct a_type' changed:
          type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
          1 data member insertion:
            'char m_char', at offset 0 (in bits)
          1 data member change:
