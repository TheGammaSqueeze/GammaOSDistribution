1 Removed function:

  [D] 'method virtual int non_defined_class::virtual_func_to_be_removed()'    {_ZN17non_defined_class26virtual_func_to_be_removedEv}
    note that this removes an entry from the vtable of class non_defined_class

1 Added function:

  [A] 'method virtual int non_defined_class::virtual_func_inserted()'    {_ZN17non_defined_class21virtual_func_insertedEv}
    note that this adds a new entry to the vtable of class non_defined_class

2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'method virtual int non_defined_class::virtual_func0()' at test30-priv-lib-v1.h:15:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
    the vtable offset of method virtual int non_defined_class::virtual_func0() changed from 3 to 4
      note that this is an ABI incompatible change to the vtable of class non_defined_class

  [C] 'function int public_function(S*)' at test30-pub-lib-v1.cc:22:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'class S' at test30-pub-lib-v1.h:1:1:
        type size hasn't changed
        1 data member change:
          type of 'S::priv_type* priv' changed:
            in pointed to type 'class S::priv_type' at test30-pub-lib-v1.cc:14:1:
              type size changed from 64 to 128 (in bits)
              1 data member insertion:
                'int member1', at offset 64 (in bits) at test30-pub-lib-v1.cc:18:1
