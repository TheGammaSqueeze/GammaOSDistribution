2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'function void bar(S1*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S1*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S1':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 base class insertion:
          struct base
        1 data member change:
          'int m0' offset changed from 0 to 32 (in bits) (by +32 bits)

  [C] 'function char bar(int, S2**)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 2 of type 'S2**' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'S2*':
        in pointed to type 'struct S2':
          type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
          1 base class insertion:
            struct base
          1 data member change:
            'int m0' offset changed from 0 to 32 (in bits) (by +32 bits)
