3 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'function void bar(S1*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S1*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S1':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 base class insertion:
          struct base
        1 data member change:
          'int m0' offset changed from 0 to 32 (in bits) (by +32 bits)

  [C] 'function int bar(S&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S&' has sub-type changes:
      in referenced type 'struct S':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 base class insertion:
          struct base
        1 data member change:
