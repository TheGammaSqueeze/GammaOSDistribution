functions defined in library 'libtest8-fn-changed-libapp-v1.so'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test8-fn-changed-app' expects:

  function int foo(S*):
    parameter 1 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S' at test8-fn-changed-libapp-v1.h:1:1:
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'char m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test8-fn-changed-libapp-v1.h:4:1
