functions defined in library 'libtest5-fn-changed-libapp-v1.so'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test5-fn-changed-app' expects:

  function void bar(S0*):
    parameter 1 of type 'S0*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S0' at test5-fn-changed-libapp-v1.h:1:1:
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'char m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test5-fn-changed-libapp-v1.h:4:1

  function int foo(S1*):
    parameter 1 of type 'S1*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S1' at test5-fn-changed-libapp-v1.h:9:1:
        type size changed from 64 to 32 (in bits)
        1 data member deletion:
          'unsigned char m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test5-fn-changed-libapp-v0.h:11:1
