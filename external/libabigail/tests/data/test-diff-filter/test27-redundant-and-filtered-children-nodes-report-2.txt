  [C] 'function S0* bar(S1*, S2*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    return type changed:
      in pointed to type 'struct S0':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'char m1', at offset 32 (in bits)
    parameter 1 of type 'S1*' changed:
      in pointed to type 'struct S1':
        entity changed from 'struct S1' to compatible type 'typedef S1Renamed'
    parameter 2 of type 'S2*' changed:
      in pointed to type 'struct S2':
        entity changed from 'struct S2' to compatible type 'typedef S2Renamed'

  [C] 'function void foo(S&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S&' has sub-type changes:
      in referenced type 'struct S':
        type size hasn't changed
        3 data member changes:
          type of 'S0* m0' changed:
            pointed to type 'struct S0' changed, as reported earlier
          type of 'S1* m1' changed:
            in pointed to type 'struct S1':
              entity changed from 'struct S1' to compatible type 'typedef S1Renamed'
          type of 'S2* m2' changed:
            in pointed to type 'struct S2':
              entity changed from 'struct S2' to compatible type 'typedef S2Renamed'
