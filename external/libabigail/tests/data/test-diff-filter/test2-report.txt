    implicit parameter 0 of type 'C1*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'class C1':

        1 data member insertion:
          'int m1', at offset 32 (in bits)

  [C] 'function void foo(C0&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'C0&' has sub-type changes:
      in referenced type 'struct C0':
        type size changed from 16 to 24 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
