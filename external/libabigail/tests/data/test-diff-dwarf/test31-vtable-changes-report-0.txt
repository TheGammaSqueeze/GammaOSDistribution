1 Removed function:

  [D] 'method virtual void S::fn0()'
    note that this removes an entry from the vtable of struct S

3 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'method virtual void S::fn1()' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    the vtable offset of method virtual void S::fn1() changed from 3 to 2
      note that this is an ABI incompatible change to the vtable of struct S
    implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S':
        type size hasn't changed
        1 member function deletion:
          'method virtual void S::fn0()', virtual at voffset 2/3
        4 member function changes:
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
              pointed to type 'struct S' changed, as being reported
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
              pointed to type 'struct S' changed, as being reported
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
