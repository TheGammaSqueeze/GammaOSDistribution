1 Added function:

  [A] 'method virtual void S::fvtable_breaker()'
    note that this adds a new entry to the vtable of struct S

4 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'method virtual void S::fn0()' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S':
        type size hasn't changed
        1 member function insertion:
          'method virtual void S::fvtable_breaker()', virtual at voffset 3/4
        5 member function changes:
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
              pointed to type 'struct S' changed, as being reported
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
              pointed to type 'struct S' changed, as being reported
          'method virtual S::~S(int)' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:

          'method virtual void S::fn0()' has some sub-type changes:
            implicit parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
              pointed to type 'struct S' changed, as being reported
          'method virtual void S::fn1()' has some sub-type changes:
            the vtable offset of method virtual void S::fn1() changed from 3 to 4
              note that this is an ABI incompatible change to the vtable of struct S
