2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C] 'function void bar(S1&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S1&' has sub-type changes:
      in referenced type 'struct S1':
        type size changed from 96 to 64 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'char m01', at offset 32 (in bits)
        2 data member changes:
          anonymous data member struct {int m0; char m01;} at offset 0 (in bits) became data member 'int m0'
          and size changed from 64 to 32 (in bits) (by -32 bits)
          'char m1' offset changed from 64 to 40 (in bits) (by -24 bits)

  [C] 'function void foo(S0&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 1 of type 'S0&' has sub-type changes:
      in referenced type 'struct S0':
        type size hasn't changed
        data member 'S0::m0' was replaced by anonymous data member:
          'union {int m0; char m01;}'
