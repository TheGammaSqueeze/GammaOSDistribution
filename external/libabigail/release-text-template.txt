Subject Libabigail <insert-version-number-here> is out!

Libabigail <insert-version-number-here> has been released.

You can download it at http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/libabigail/libabigail-<insert-version-number-here>.tar.gz.

Libabigail is a library which aims at constructing, manipulating,
serializing and de-serializing ABI-relevant artifacts.

It also comes with a set of associated command line tools to compare
the interfaces of ELF binaries resulting from the compilation of C or
C++ programs.

Typical use cases of libabigail tools include detecting ABI
incompatible changes across several releases of shared libraries or
incompatible changes in the interface between a Linux kernel and its
modules, for instance.

Users can of course write their own tools using the library.

The library comes with extensive API documentation available online at
https://sourceware.org/libabigail/apidoc.  The tools are documented
online as well at https://sourceware.org/libabigail/manual/libabigail-tools.html.
