description:
    "This project contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and "
    "generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. It also includes "
    "the default implementation of handler types (parser, generator) that "
    "handle JSON format. The core abstractions are not JSON specific, although "
    "naming does contain 'JSON' in many places, due to historical reasons. Only "
    "packages that specifically contain word 'json' are JSON-specific."
