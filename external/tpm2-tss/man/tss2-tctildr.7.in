.SH NAME
tss2-tctildr \- Simplifiy management of TCTI instance lifecycle.
.SH SYNOPSIS
This library simplifies the instantiation and finalization of TCTI
instances.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The TCTI dynamic loading and initialization protocol requires a lot of
boilerplate code. To reduce duplication the tss2-tctildr library adds the
'Tss2_TctiLdr_Initialize', 'Tss2_TctiLdr_Initialize_Ex' and
'Tss2_TctiLdr_Finalize' functions to abstract away the machinery required
to load, initialize, and finalize a TCTI context.

To assist in the discovery of TCTIs this library provides the
'Tss2_TctiLdr_GetInfo' function. This function, paired with a 'free'
function to free the memory allocated by 'GetInfo', provides a simple
query interface for discovery of the available and default TCTIs
available to the tss2-tctildr implementation

The interface exposed by this library is defined in the \*(lqTSS System
Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface Specification\*(rq.
