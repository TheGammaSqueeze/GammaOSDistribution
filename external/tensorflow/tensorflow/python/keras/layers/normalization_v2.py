class SyncBatchNormalization(normalization.BatchNormalizationBase):
  r"""Normalize and scale inputs or activations synchronously across replicas.

  Applies batch normalization to activations of the previous layer at each batch
  by synchronizing the global batch statistics across all devices that are
  training the model. For specific details about batch normalization please
  refer to the `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` layer docs.

  If this layer is used when using tf.distribute strategy to train models
  across devices/workers, there will be an allreduce call to aggregate batch
  statistics across all replicas at every training step. Without tf.distribute
  strategy, this layer behaves as a regular `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`
  layer.

  Example usage:

  ```python
  strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

  with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(16))
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization())
  ```

  Args:
    axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized
      (typically the features axis).
      For instance, after a `Conv2D` layer with
      `data_format="channels_first"`,
      set `axis=1` in `BatchNormalization`.
    momentum: Momentum for the moving average.
    epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
    center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor.
      If False, `beta` is ignored.
    scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`.
      If False, `gamma` is not used.
      When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`),
      this can be disabled since the scaling
      will be done by the next layer.
    beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight.
    gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight.
    moving_mean_initializer: Initializer for the moving mean.
    moving_variance_initializer: Initializer for the moving variance.
    beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
    gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
    beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight.
    gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode.
      - `training=True`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the
        mean and variance of the current batch of inputs.
      - `training=False`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the
        mean and variance of its moving statistics, learned during training.

  Input shape:
    Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape`
    (tuple of integers, does not include the samples axis)
    when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

  Output shape:
    Same shape as input.

class BatchNormalization(normalization.BatchNormalizationBase):
  """Layer that normalizes its inputs.

  Batch normalization applies a transformation that maintains the mean output
  close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1.

  Importantly, batch normalization works differently during training and
  during inference.

  **During training** (i.e. when using `fit()` or when calling the layer/model
  with the argument `training=True`), the layer normalizes its output using
  the mean and standard deviation of the current batch of inputs. That is to
  say, for each channel being normalized, the layer returns
  `(batch - mean(batch)) / (var(batch) + epsilon) * gamma + beta`, where:

  - `epsilon` is small constant (configurable as part of the constructor
  arguments)
  - `gamma` is a learned scaling factor (initialized as 1), which
  can be disabled by passing `scale=False` to the constructor.
  - `beta` is a learned offset factor (initialized as 0), which
  can be disabled by passing `center=False` to the constructor.

  **During inference** (i.e. when using `evaluate()` or `predict()` or when
  calling the layer/model with the argument `training=False` (which is the
  default), the layer normalizes its output using a moving average of the
  mean and standard deviation of the batches it has seen during training. That
  is to say, it returns
  `(batch - self.moving_mean) / (self.moving_var + epsilon) * gamma + beta`.

  `self.moving_mean` and `self.moving_var` are non-trainable variables that
  are updated each time the layer in called in training mode, as such:

  - `moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + mean(batch) * (1 - momentum)`
  - `moving_var = moving_var * momentum + var(batch) * (1 - momentum)`

  As such, the layer will only normalize its inputs during inference
  *after having been trained on data that has similar statistics as the
  inference data*.

  Args:
    axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized (typically the features
      axis). For instance, after a `Conv2D` layer with

    epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
    center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor. If False, `beta`
      is ignored.
    scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`. If False, `gamma` is not used. When the
      next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`), this can be disabled since the
      scaling will be done by the next layer.
    beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight.
    gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight.

    beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
    gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
    beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight.
    gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).

      training mode or in inference mode.
      - `training=True`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the mean and
        variance of the current batch of inputs.
      - `training=False`: The layer will normalize its inputs using the mean and
        variance of its moving statistics, learned during training.

  Input shape:
    Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of
    integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as the
    first layer in a model.

  Output shape:
    Same shape as input.

  **About setting `layer.trainable = False` on a `BatchNormalization` layer:**

  The meaning of setting `layer.trainable = False` is to freeze the layer,
  i.e. its internal state will not change during training:
  its trainable weights will not be updated
  during `fit()` or `train_on_batch()`, and its state updates will not be run.

  Usually, this does not necessarily mean that the layer is run in inference
  mode (which is normally controlled by the `training` argument that can
  be passed when calling a layer). "Frozen state" and "inference mode"
  are two separate concepts.

  However, in the case of the `BatchNormalization` layer, **setting
  `trainable = False` on the layer means that the layer will be
  subsequently run in inference mode** (meaning that it will use
  the moving mean and the moving variance to normalize the current batch,
  rather than using the mean and variance of the current batch).

  This behavior has been introduced in TensorFlow 2.0, in order
  to enable `layer.trainable = False` to produce the most commonly
  expected behavior in the convnet fine-tuning use case.

  Note that:
    - Setting `trainable` on an model containing other layers will
      recursively set the `trainable` value of all inner layers.
    - If the value of the `trainable`
      attribute is changed after calling `compile()` on a model,
      the new value doesn't take effect for this model
      until `compile()` is called again.
