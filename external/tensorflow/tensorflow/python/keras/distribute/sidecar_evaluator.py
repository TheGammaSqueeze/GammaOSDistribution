class SidecarEvaluator(object):
  """A class designed for a dedicated evaluator task.

  `SidecarEvaluator` is expected to be run on a process in
  a separate machine from the training cluster. It continuously loads
  checkpoints saved periodically by that training counterpart, and performs
  evaluation using the model (with compiled metrics) provided at `__init__`. It
  is expected to be used for the purpose of a dedicated evaluator, evaluating
  the metric results of a training cluster which has one or more workers
  performing the training and saving checkpoints. `SidecarEvaluator` uses
  `model.evaluate` for evaluation.

  Example:
  ```python
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...)
  model.compile(metrics=tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(
      name="eval_metrics"))
  data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(...)

  SidecarEvaluator(
      model=model,
      data=data,
      checkpoint_dir='/tmp/checkpoint_dir',  # dir for training-saved checkpoint
      steps=None,  # Eval until dataset is exhausted
      log_dir='/tmp/log_dir',
      max_evaluations=None  # The evaluation needs to be stopped manually
  ).start()
  ```

  `SidecarEvaluator.start` writes a series of summary
  files which can be visualized by tensorboard (which provides a webpage link):

  ```bash
  $ tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/log_dir
  ...
  TensorBoard 2.4.0a0 at http://host:port (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  ```

  The `checkpoint_dir` should contain checkpoints that track `model` and
  `optimizer` to fulfill `SidecarEvaluator`'s
  expectation:

  ```python
  checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)
  checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(
      checkpoint, checkpoint_dir=..., max_to_keep=...)
  checkpoint_manager.save()
  ```

  """

               max_evaluations=None):
    """Initializes an `SidecarEvaluator` object.

    Args:
      model: Model to use for evaluation. The model object used here should be a
        `tf.keras.Model`, and should be the same as the one that is used in
        training, where `tf.keras.Model`s are checkpointed. The model should
        have one or more metrics compiled before using `SidecarEvaluator`.
      data: The input data for evaluation. `SidecarEvaluator` supports all data
        types that Keras `model.evaluate` supports as the input data `x`, such
        as a `tf.data.Dataset`.
      checkpoint_dir: Directory where checkpoint files are saved.
      log_dir: Directory where summary files for TensorBoard are saved.
      steps: Number of steps to perform evaluation for, when evaluating a single
        checkpoint file. If `None`, evaluation continues until the dataset is
        exhausted. For repeated evaluation dataset, user must specify `steps` to
        avoid infinite evaluation loop.
      max_evaluations: Maximum number of the checkpoint file to be evaluated,
        for `SidecarEvaluator` to know when to stop. The evaluator will stop
        after it evaluates a checkpoint filepath ending with
        '<ckpt_name>-<max_evaluations>'. If using
        `tf.train.CheckpointManager.save` for saving checkpoints, the kth saved
        checkpoint has the filepath suffix '<ckpt_name>-<k>' (k=1 for the first
        saved), and if checkpoints are saved every epoch after training, the
        filepath saved at the kth epoch would end with '<ckpt_name>-<k>. Thus,
        if training runs for n epochs, and the evaluator should end after the
        training finishes, use n for this parameter. Note that this is not
        necessarily equal to the number of total evaluations, since some
        checkpoints may be skipped if evaluation is slower than checkpoint
        creation. If `None`, `SidecarEvaluator` will evaluate indefinitely, and
        the user must terminate evaluator program themselves.
