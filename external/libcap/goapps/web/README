This sample program needs to be built as follows (when built with Go
prior to 1.15):

   CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW="-Wl,-?-wrap[=,][^-.@][^,]*" go build web.go

go1.15+ does not require the CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW variable and can build
this code with

   go build web.go

A more complete walk through of what this code does is provided here:

Go compilers prior to go1.11.13 are not expected to work. Report more
