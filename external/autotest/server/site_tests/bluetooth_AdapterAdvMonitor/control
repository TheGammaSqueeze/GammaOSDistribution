    A Batch of Bluetooth Advertisement Monitor API tests. This test is written
    as a batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp up
    time is costly. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper
    methods to start and end a test and a batch of tests.

    This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a specific
    test only. More information about the tests can be found here:
    go/bt-advmon-api-test-plan
