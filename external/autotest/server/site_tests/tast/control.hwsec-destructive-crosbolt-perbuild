Run the Tast crosbolt performance test suite with test group hwsec_destructive.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Tast-based crosbolt performance tests against a remote DUT.
And runs HWSec Tast-based remote tests that may wipe and recreate
encstateful in the middle, e.g., via clearing the TPM. It only reports failure
if the tast process itself (rather than individual Tast tests) fails.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
