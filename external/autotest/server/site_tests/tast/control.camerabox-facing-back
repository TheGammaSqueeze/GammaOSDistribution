Run the Tast camerabox_facing-back test suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs all Tast-based back camera tests against a remote DUT in back
facing camerabox setup.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
