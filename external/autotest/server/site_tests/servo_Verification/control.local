The local version of servo_Verification. Local in this context means that
for the tests that require an image to be placed on the usb stick to run
the test will assume an image is already present, and not attempt to download
and image itself.

For more details, please see the DOC section in the file 'control'.

Sample usage:
test_that <dut ip> servo_Verification.local --args "servo_host=<labstation ip>
                                              servo_port=<port on labstation>"
