This is not a test. This 'test' checks the chameleond version on the
Bluetooth peer and updates if it is less that expected version in the test.

Use this test if you have made a change to chameleond which should be deployed
in the lab.

Please follow the steps to update chameleond version in the lab.

1) Test and update chameleond code
- Deploy the change in chameleon in a local bt peer
  and run bluetooth_AdapterQuickHealth against it.
- Merge the changes

2) After chameleond changes are merged
- run make in chameleon folder
- get the git commit using the command 'git log HEAD^..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h"'
- rename the dist/chameleond-0.0.2.tar.gz to chameleond-0.0.2-<git commit>.tar.gz
- create a text file named 'latest_bluetooth_commit' with following format
'
commit : <git commit>
'
- upload the latest file and  chameleond-0.0.2-<git commit>.tar.gz to
  https://pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser/chromeos-localmirror/distfiles/bluetooth_peer_bundle

Once the files are uploaded, the test will start updating the peers in the lab.

Note: Due to way the scheduler works, if there is more than one DUT of same
model, test will be run only on one of them. Thus the process is indeterministic
now but over a large period of time all the peer devices in the lab should(?)
be updated.
