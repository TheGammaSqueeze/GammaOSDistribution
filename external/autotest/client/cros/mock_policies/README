This directory contains the ingredients necessary to regenerate
signed mock policies and the corresponding public keys.  See here
for details on how to use this code:

https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/chromeos/archive/testing-tools-for-device-policies

Please use ../mock_owner_private.key as the private key.
Please use madmax@managedchrome.com as the user for generating
mock_metrics_{on,off}.policy
protoc --decode_raw is useful for verifying your work by comparing old
proto and the new.

If you are having to regenerate these files, most likely you have to
change the code in this directory.  Please keep the code up-to-date in git.
