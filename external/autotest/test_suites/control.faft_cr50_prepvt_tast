DOC = """
The suite is the Tast counterpart of suite:faft_cr50_prepvt.

The reason why we need a separate suite is because "test_that" command
cannot run Tast tests if devserver is not presented (crbug.com/948805).
Placing Tast tests on this suite can avoid possible regression of
suite:faft_cr50_prepvt.

Note that the prevpt and pvt suites are identical.
The two names are to make searches for faft_cr50_p* include Tast results.
