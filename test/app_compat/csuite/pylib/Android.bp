// The below module creates a standalone zip that end-to-end tests can depend
// on for running the suite. This is a workaround since we can't use csuite.zip
// which is defined in an external Makefile that Soong can't depend on.
//
// Besides listing jars we know the launcher script depends on which is
// brittle, this is a hack for several reasons. First, we're listing our
// dependencies in the tools attribute when we should be using the 'srcs'
// attribute. Second, we're accessing jars using a path relative to a known
// artifact location instead of using the Soong 'location' feature.
//
// Normally we would just use java_genrule_host to avoid these hacks but can't
// do that since Soong currently complains when a python_host_test depends on
// that target since, although compatible, the arch variants (x86_64 and
// common) don't exactly match.
