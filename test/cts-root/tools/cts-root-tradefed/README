CTS-Root Trade Federation
-------------------------

CTS-Root Trade Federation, cts-root-tradefed for short, is built on
top of the Android Trade Federation test harness for general compatibility tests
that require root privileges or a debuggable device to run.

Configuring cts-root-tradefed
-----------------------------

Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

And ensure device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using cts-root-tradefed
-----------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the cts-root-tradefed console by running 'cts-root-tradefed'. If you
are working from the Android source tree and have run 'm cts_root',
the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/ats/android-cts_root/tools/cts-root-tradefed
3. Type:
'run cts-root' to run the default MTS plan

Some other useful commands are

To run a test module:
'run cts-root --module <module_name>'

To run a specific test:
'run cts-root --test <test_name>'

To shard a plan test run on multiple devices
'run cts-root --shards <number of shards>
note: all connected devices must be running the same build

For more options:
'run cts-root --help'

CTS-Root Tradefed Development
-----------------------------
See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run cts-root-tradefed from the development
environment:
cd <path to android source root>
m cts_root
cts-root-tradefed
