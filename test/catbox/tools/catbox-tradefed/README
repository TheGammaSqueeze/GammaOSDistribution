CATBOX Trade Federation
------------------------

CATBOX Trade Federation, catbox-tradefed for short, is the next
generation test harness for CAT (Complete Automotive Testing).

catbox-tradefed is built on top of the Android Trade Federation test harness.

Configuring catbox-tradefed
----------------------------

1. Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

2. Follow the 'ADB and AAPT' setup steps documented in the
User Manual. The User Manual can be found at
https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/setup#adb

3. Connect the device to the host machine.

4. Ensure device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using catbox-tradefed
----------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the catbox-tradefed console by running the 'catbox-tradefed'. If you've
downloaded and extracted the CATBOX zip, the script can be found at
  android-catbox/tools/catbox-tradefed
Or else if you are working from the Android source tree and have run make catbox,
the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/catbox/android-catbox/tools/catbox-tradefed
3. Type:
'run catbox' to run the default CATBOX plan

Some other useful commands are

To run a test module:
'run catbox --module <module_name>'

To run a specific test:
'run catbox --test <test_name>'

To shard a plan test run on multiple devices
'run catbox --shards <number of shards>
note: all connected devices must be running the same build

For more options:
'run catbox --help'

CATBOX Tradefed Development
----------------------------
See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run catbox-tradefed from the development
environment:
cd <path to android source root>
make catbox
catbox-tradefed

More documentation and details on using and extending trade federation will
be forthcoming in the near future.
