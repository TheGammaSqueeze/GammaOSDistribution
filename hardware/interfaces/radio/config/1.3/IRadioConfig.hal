 * This interface is used by telephony and telecom to talk to cellular radio for the purpose of
 * radio configuration, and it is not associated with any specific modem or slot.
 * All the functions have minimum one parameter:
 * serial: which corresponds to serial no. of request. Serial numbers must only be memorized for the
 * duration of a method call. If clients provide colliding serials (including passing the same
 * serial to different methods), multiple responses (one for each method call) must still be served.
