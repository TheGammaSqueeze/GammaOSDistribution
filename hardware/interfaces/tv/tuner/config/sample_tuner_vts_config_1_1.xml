        <!-- Frontends section:
            This section contains configurations of all the frontends that would be used
                in the tests.
                - This section is optional and can be skipped to use the default fe settings.
                - The default settings can be found in the sample_tuner_vts_configurations.xml.
                - The users can also override the default frontend settings using id="FE_DEFAULT".
                - The users can configure 1 or more frontend elements in the frontends sections.

            Each frontend element contain the following attributes:
                "id": unique id of the frontend that could be used to connect to the test the
                    "dataFlowConfiguration"
                "type": the frontend type. The enums are defined in the xsd.
                "isSoftwareFrontend": if the test environment is using hardware or software
                    frontend. If using software, a ts input file path needs to be configured.
                "softwareFeInputPath": used as the source of the software frontend.
                "connectToCicamId": if the device supports frontend connecting to cicam, the target
                    cicam id needs to be configured here. Supported in Tuner 1.1 or higher.
                "frequency": the frequency used to configure tune and scan.
                "endFrequency": the end frequency of scan. Supported in Tuner 1.1 or higher.

            Each frontend element also contains one and only one type-related "frontendSettings".
                - The settings type should match the frontend "type" attribute.
                - For example, when frontend type="DVBT", dvbtFrontendSettings can be configured.
                - This is optional and skipping the settings would pass a setting with frequency
                    config only to the hal.

                - This section is optional and can be skipped to use the default filter settings.
                - The default settings can be found in the sample_tuner_vts_configurations.xml.
                - The users can also override the default filter settings using
                - id="FILTER_AUDIO_DEFAULT" or "FILTER_VIDEO_DEFAULT".
                - The users can configure 1 or more filter elements in the filters sections.

            Each filter element contain the following attributes:
                "id": unique id of the filter that could be used to connect to the test the
                    "dataFlowConfiguration"
                "mainType": the main filter type. The enums are defined in the xsd.

                "bufferSize": the buffer size of the filter in hex.
                "pid": the pid that would be used to configure the filter.
                "useFMQ": if the filter uses FMQ.

            Each filter element also contains at most one type-related "filterSettings".
                - The settings type should match the filter "subType" attribute.
                - For example, when filter subType is audio or video, the avFilterSettings can be
                    configured.
                - This is optional and skipping the settings would pass a setting with tpid config
                    only to the hal.
