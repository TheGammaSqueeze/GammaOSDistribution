     * Provides additional authentication data (AAD) to a cryptographic operation begun with

     * method may be called multiple times, supplying the AAD in chunks, but may not be called after
     * update() is called.  If updateAad() is called after update(), it must return
     * ErrorCode::INVALID_TAG.

     * If the operation is in an invalid state (was aborted or had an error) update() must return
     * ErrorCode::INVALID_OPERATION_HANDLE.

     * If this method returns an error code other than ErrorCode::OK, the operation is aborted and

     *

     *
     * o One or more Tag::USER_SECURE_IDs, and
     *
     * o Does not have a Tag::AUTH_TIMEOUT

     * In this case, the key requires an authorization per operation, and the update method must
     * receive a non-null and valid HardwareAuthToken.  For the auth token to be valid, all of the
     * following has to be true:
     *
     *   o The HMAC field must validate correctly.
     *
     *   o At least one of the Tag::USER_SECURE_ID values from the key must match at least one of
     *     the secure ID values in the token.
     *
     *   o The key must have a Tag::USER_AUTH_TYPE that matches the auth type in the token.
     *
     *   o The challenge field in the auth token must contain the value returned from
     *     IKeyMintDevice::begin(), given by the challenge field of the BeginResult structure.
     *
     *   If any of these conditions are not met, updateAad() must return
     *   ErrorCode::KEY_USER_NOT_AUTHENTICATED.
     *
     * The caller must provide the auth token on every call to updateAad(), update() and finish().
     *
     *
     * For GCM encryption, the AEAD tag must be appended to the ciphertext by finish().  During
     * decryption, the last Tag::MAC_LENGTH bytes of the data provided to the last update call must
     * be the AEAD tag.  Since a given invocation of update cannot know if it's the last invocation,
     * it must process all but the tag length and buffer the possible tag data for processing during
     * finish().
     *
     * @param input Additional Authentication Data to be processed.
     *
     * @param authToken Authentication token, if provided.
     *
     * @param timeStampToken timestamp token, certifies the freshness of an auth token in case
     *        the security domain of this KeyMint instance has a different clock than the
     *        authenticator issuing the auth token.

     *     BeginResult returned from IKeyMintDevice::begin().
     *
     *   If any of these conditions are not met, update() must return

     * accept the data this way as well.  If the caller provides more data to sign than can be used
     * (length of data exceeds RSA key size), update() must return ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH.

     *
     * == Authorization enforcement ==
     *
     * Key authorization enforcement is performed primarily in begin().  The exceptions are
     * authorization per operation keys and confirmation-required keys.
     *
     * Authorization per operation keys are the case where the key has one or more
     * Tag::USER_SECURE_IDs, and does not have a Tag::AUTH_TIMEOUT.  In this case, the key requires
     * an authorization per operation, and the finish method must receive a non-empty and valid
     * authToken.  For the auth token to be valid, all of the following has to be true:
     *
     *   o The HMAC field must validate correctly.
     *
     *   o At least one of the Tag::USER_SECURE_ID values from the key must match at least one of
     *     the secure ID values in the token.
     *
     *   o The key must have a Tag::USER_AUTH_TYPE that matches the auth type in the token.
     *
     *   o The challenge field in the auth token must contain the operation challenge.
     *
     *   If any of these conditions are not met, update() must return
     *   ErrorCode::KEY_USER_NOT_AUTHENTICATED.
     *
     * The caller must provide the auth token on every call to update() and finish().
     *
     * Confirmation-required keys are keys that were generated with
     * Tag::TRUSTED_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED.  For these keys, when doing a signing operation the
     * caller must pass a KeyParameter Tag::CONFIRMATION_TOKEN to finish().  Implementations must
     * check the confirmation token by computing the 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 over all of the
     * to-be-signed data, prefixed with the 18-byte UTF-8 encoded string "confirmation token". If
     * the computed value does not match the Tag::CONFIRMATION_TOKEN parameter, finish() must not
     * produce a signature and must return ErrorCode::NO_USER_CONFIRMATION.
     *
     * -- RSA keys --
     *
     * Some additional requirements, depending on the padding mode:
     *
     * o PaddingMode::NONE.  For unpadded signing and encryption operations, if the provided data is
     *   shorter than the key, the data must be zero-padded on the left before signing/encryption.
     *   If the data is the same length as the key, but numerically larger, finish() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INVALID_ARGUMENT.  For decryption operations, the data must be exactly as long
     *   as the key.  Otherwise, return ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH.
     *
     * o PaddingMode::RSA_PSS.  For PSS-padded signature operations, the PSS salt length must match
     *   the size of the PSS digest selected.  The digest specified with Tag::DIGEST in params
     *   on begin() must be used as the PSS digest algorithm, MGF1 must be used as the mask
     *   generation function and SHA1 must be used as the MGF1 digest algorithm.
     *
     * -- ECDSA keys --
     *
     * If the data provided for undigested signing is too long, truncate it.
     *
     * -- AES keys --
     *
     * Some additional conditions, depending on block mode:
     *
     * o BlockMode::ECB or BlockMode::CBC.  If padding is PaddingMode::NONE and the data length is
     *   not a multiple of the AES block size, finish() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH.  If padding is PaddingMode::PKCS7, pad the data per the
     *   PKCS#7 specification, including adding an additional padding block if the data is a
     *   multiple of the block length.
     *
     * o BlockMode::GCM.  During encryption, after processing all plaintext, compute the tag
     *   (Tag::MAC_LENGTH bytes) and append it to the returned ciphertext.  During decryption,
     *   process the last Tag::MAC_LENGTH bytes as the tag.  If tag verification fails, finish()
     *   must return ErrorCode::VERIFICATION_FAILED.
     *
     * @param input Data to be processed, per the parameters established in the call to begin().
     *        finish() must consume all provided data or return ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH.
     *
     * @param signature The signature to be verified if the purpose specified in the begin() call
     *        was KeyPurpose::VERIFY.
     *
     * @param authToken Authentication token. Can be nullable if not provided.
     *
     * @param timestampToken certifies the freshness of an auth token in case the security domain of
     *        this KeyMint instance has a different clock than the authenticator issuing the auth
     *        token.
     *
     * @param confirmationToken is the confirmation token required by keys with
     *        Tag::TRUSTED_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED.
     *
     * @return The output data, if any.
