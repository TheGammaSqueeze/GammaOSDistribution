"bc is a command-line, arbitrary-precision calculator with a Turing-complete\n"
"language. For details, use `man %s` or see the online documentation at\n"
"https://git.yzena.com/gavin/bc/src/tag/%s/manuals/bc/%s.1.md.\n"
"\n"
"This bc is compatible with both the GNU bc and the POSIX bc spec. See the GNU bc\n"
"manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html) and bc spec\n"
"(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html)\n"
"for details.\n"
"\n"
"This bc has three differences to the GNU bc:\n"
"\n"
"  1) Arrays can be passed to the builtin \"length\" function to get the number of\n"
"     elements currently in the array. The following example prints \"1\":\n"
"\n"
"       a[0] = 0\n"
"       length(a[])\n"
"\n"
"  2) The precedence of the boolean \"not\" operator (!) is equal to that of the\n"
"     unary minus (-), or negation, operator. This still allows POSIX-compliant\n"
"     scripts to work while somewhat preserving expected behavior (versus C) and\n"
"     making parsing easier.\n"
"  3) This bc has many more extensions than the GNU bc does. For details, see the\n"
"     man page or online documentation.\n"
"\n"
"This bc also implements the dot (.) extension of the BSD bc.\n"
"\n"
"Options:\n"
"\n"
"  -e  expr  --expression=expr\n"
"\n"
"      Run \"expr\" and quit. If multiple expressions or files (see below) are\n"
"      given, they are all run before executing from stdin.\n"
"\n"
"  -f  file  --file=file\n"
"\n"
"      Run the bc code in \"file\" and exit. See above as well.\n"
"\n"
"  -g  --global-stacks\n"
"\n"
"      Turn scale, ibase, and obase into stacks. This makes the value of each be\n"
"      be restored on returning from functions. See the man page or online\n"
"      documentation for more details.\n"
"\n"
"  -h  --help\n"
"\n"
"      Print this usage message and exit.\n"
"\n"
"  -i  --interactive\n"
"\n"
"      Force interactive mode.\n"
"\n"
"  -l  --mathlib\n"
"\n"
"      Use predefined math routines:\n"
"\n"
"          s(expr)  =  sine of expr in radians\n"
"          c(expr)  =  cosine of expr in radians\n"
"          a(expr)  =  arctangent of expr, returning radians\n"
"          l(expr)  =  natural log of expr\n"
"          e(expr)  =  raises e to the power of expr\n"
"          j(n, x)  =  Bessel function of integer order n of x\n"
"\n"
"      This bc may load more functions with these options. See the manpage or\n"
"      online documentation for details.\n"
"\n"
"  -P  --no-prompt\n"
"\n"
"      Disable the prompts in interactive mode.\n"
