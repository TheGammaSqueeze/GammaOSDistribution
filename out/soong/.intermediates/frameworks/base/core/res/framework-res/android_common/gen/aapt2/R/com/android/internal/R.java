     * used for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs
     * normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs

     * aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languages like Arabic,
     * Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be
     * aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.
     * However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag
     * especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII

     * an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some
     * IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small
     * screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to
     * present a UI for this option.  Like actionNext, if the

     * input method is full-screen.
     * Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
     * is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
     * that you think showing text being edited is more important than the

     * <tr><td>flagNoEnterAction</td><td>40000000</td><td>Used in conjunction with a custom action,
     * this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as
     * a replacement for the "enter" key.  Typically this is
     * because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable
     * enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending
     * a message.    Note that {@link android.widget.TextView} will

     * often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part
     * of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited
     * access to the application available from the user, it can make the
     * experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
     * this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able
     * to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is
     * not needed.
     * <p>Corresponds to

     * <tr><td>flagNoFullscreen</td><td>2000000</td><td>Used to request that the IME never go

     * <tr><td>flagNoPersonalizedLearning</td><td>1000000</td><td>Used to request that the IME should not update any personalized data such as typing
     * history and personalized language model based on what the user typed on this text
     * editing object. Typical use cases are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>When the application is in a special mode, where user's activities are expected
     * to be not recorded in the application's history. Some web browsers and chat
     * applications may have this kind of modes.</li>
     * <li>When storing typing history does not make much sense.  Specifying this flag in

     * the user is less likely to type in their daily life.  Another example is that when
     * the application already knows that the expected input is not a valid word (e.g. a
     * promotion code that is not a valid word in any natural language).</li>
