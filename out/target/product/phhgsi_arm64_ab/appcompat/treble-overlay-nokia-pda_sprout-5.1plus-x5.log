appcompat.sh output:
NOTE: appcompat.sh is still under development. It can report
API uses that do not execute at runtime, and reflection uses
that do not exist. It can also miss on reflection uses.
0 hidden API(s) used: 0 linked against, 0 through reflection
	0 in unsupported
	0 in blocked
	0 in max-target-o

To run an analysis that can give more reflection accesses, 
but could include false positives, pass the --imprecise flag.
