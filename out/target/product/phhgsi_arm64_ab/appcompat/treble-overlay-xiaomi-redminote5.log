appcompat.sh output:
NOTE: appcompat.sh is still under development. It can report
API uses that do not execute at runtime, and reflection uses
that do not exist. It can also miss on reflection uses.

To run an analysis that can give more reflection accesses, 
but could include false positives, pass the --imprecise flag.
