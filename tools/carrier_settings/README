This tool converts carrier config and APNs from XML format to protobuf format.

AOSP default carrier configs can be found in packages/apps/CarrierConfig,
and APNs in device/sample/etc/apns-full-conf.xml.

Usage:

$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch foo_bar
$ croot
$ source <path>/main.sh

The commands above build the tool from source code and run them.

This tool is best supported on Android 11 code base. See additional steps
in bin/README.md run it on Android 10.

Usually, if a MVNO has no APN defined in xml, the tool will use APNs of the corresponding MNO,
based on MCC/MNC values. However, a CarrierConfig carriersettingstool.no_apn_for_mvno_bool
can be set as true to avoid such copying in conversion tool.
carriersettingstool.no_apn_for_mvno_bool will also be removed from final config by the tool.
