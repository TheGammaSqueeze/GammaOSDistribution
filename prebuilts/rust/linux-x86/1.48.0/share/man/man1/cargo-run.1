.SH "NAME"
cargo\-run \- Run the current package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo run\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR \fIargs\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Run a binary or example of the local package.
.sp
All the arguments following the two dashes (\fB\-\-\fR) are passed to the binary to
run. If you're passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after
\fB\-\-\fR go to the binary, the ones before go to Cargo.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Package Selection"
By default, the package in the current working directory is selected. The \fB\-p\fR
flag can be used to choose a different package in a workspace.
.sp
\fB\-p\fR \fIspec\fR, 
\fB\-\-package\fR \fIspec\fR
.RS 4
The package to run. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fR(1) for the SPEC
format.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
When no target selection options are given, \fBcargo run\fR will run the binary
target. If there are multiple binary targets, you must pass a target flag to
choose one. Or, the \fBdefault\-run\fR field may be specified in the \fB[package]\fR
section of \fBCargo.toml\fR to choose the name of the binary to run by default.
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fR \fIname\fR
.RS 4
Run the specified binary.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-example\fR \fIname\fR
.RS 4
Run the specified example.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
The feature flags allow you to control the enabled features for the "current"
package. The "current" package is the package in the current directory, or the
one specified in \fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR\&. If running in the root of a virtual
workspace, then the default features are selected for all workspace members,
or all features if \fB\-\-all\-features\fR is specified.
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fR feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fR \fIfeatures\fR
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory's package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fR syntax. This flag may be
specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fR
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fR
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fR feature of the current directory's package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fR \fItriple\fR
.RS 4
Run for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fR\&. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fR for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode where the
target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See the
\fIbuild cache\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/guide/build\-cache.html> documentation for more details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-release\fR
.RS 4
Run optimized artifacts with the \fBrelease\fR profile. See the
PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile
selection.
.RE
.SS "Output Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fR environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. Defaults
to \fBtarget\fR in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fR, 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE

\fB\-q\fR, 
\fB\-\-quiet\fR

\fB\-\-color\fR \fIwhen\fR

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBauto\fR (default): Automatically detect if color support is available on the
terminal.
.RE
.sp

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBalways\fR: Always display colors.

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-message\-format\fR \fIfmt\fR
.RS 4
The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple times
and consists of comma\-separated values. Valid values:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBhuman\fR (default): Display in a human\-readable text format.
.RE

.RE

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBjson\-diagnostic\-short\fR: Ensure the \fBrendered\fR field of JSON messages contains
the "short" rendering from rustc.

.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBjson\-diagnostic\-rendered\-ansi\fR: Ensure the \fBrendered\fR field of JSON messages

scheme.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBjson\-render\-diagnostics\fR: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc diagnostics in
in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself should render the
JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo's own JSON diagnostics and others
coming from rustc are still emitted.
.RE
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fR file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fR file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fR, 
\fB\-\-locked\fR
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fR file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fR flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fR file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fR
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fR(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB+\fR\fItoolchain\fR
.RS 4
If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to \fBcargo\fR
begins with \fB+\fR, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such
as \fB+stable\fR or \fB+nightly\fR).
See the \fIrustup documentation\fR <https://rust\-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html>
for more information about how toolchain overrides work.

.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fR \fIN\fR, 
\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIN\fR
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\fBbuild.jobs\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SH "PROFILES"
Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See \fIthe reference\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html> for more
details.
.sp
Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
\fBdev\fR or \fBtest\fR profiles are used. If the \fB\-\-release\fR flag is given, then the
\fBrelease\fR or \fBbench\fR profiles are used.
