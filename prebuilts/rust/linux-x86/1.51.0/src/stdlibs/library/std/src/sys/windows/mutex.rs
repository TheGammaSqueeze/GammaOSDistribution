//! System Mutexes
//!
//! The Windows implementation of mutexes is a little odd and it may not be
//! immediately obvious what's going on. The primary oddness is that SRWLock is
//! used instead of CriticalSection, and this is done because:
//!
//! 1. SRWLock is several times faster than CriticalSection according to
//!    benchmarks performed on both Windows 8 and Windows 7.
//!
//! 2. CriticalSection allows recursive locking while SRWLock deadlocks. The
//!    Unix implementation deadlocks so consistency is preferred. See #19962 for
//!    more details.
//!
//! 3. While CriticalSection is fair and SRWLock is not, the current Rust policy
//!    is that there are no guarantees of fairness.
