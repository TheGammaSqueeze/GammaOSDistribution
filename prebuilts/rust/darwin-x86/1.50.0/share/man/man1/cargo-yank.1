cargo\-yank \- Remove a pushed crate from the index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo yank\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-vers\fR \fIversion\fR [\fIcrate\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The yank command removes a previously published crate's version from the
server's index. This command does not delete any data, and the crate will
still be available for download via the registry's download link.
.sp
Note that existing crates locked to a yanked version will still be able to
download the yanked version to use it. Cargo will, however, not allow any new
crates to be locked to any yanked version.
.sp
This command requires you to be authenticated with either the \fB\-\-token\fR option
or using \fBcargo\-login\fR(1).
.sp
If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from the
current directory.

\fICargo config\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html> environment variables can be
used to override the tokens stored in the credentials file. The token for
crates.io may be specified with the \fBCARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN\fR environment
variable. Tokens for other registries may be specified with environment
variables of the form \fBCARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN\fR where \fBNAME\fR is the name
of the registry in all capital letters.
