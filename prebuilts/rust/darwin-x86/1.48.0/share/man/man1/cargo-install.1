.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command manages Cargo's local set of installed binary crates. Only
packages which have executable \fB[[bin]]\fR or \fB[[example]]\fR targets can be
installed, and all executables are installed into the installation root's
\fBbin\fR folder.
.sp
The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

There are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The default
location is crates.io but the \fB\-\-git\fR, \fB\-\-path\fR, and \fB\-\-registry\fR flags can
change this source. If the source contains more than one package (such as
crates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the \fIcrate\fR argument is
required to indicate which crate should be installed.
.sp
Crates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to install
via the \fB\-\-version\fR flags, and similarly packages from git repositories can
optionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that should be installed. If a
crate has multiple binaries, the \fB\-\-bin\fR argument can selectively install only
one of them, and if you'd rather install examples the \fB\-\-example\fR argument can
be used as well.
.sp
If the package is already installed, Cargo will reinstall it if the installed
version does not appear to be up\-to\-date. If any of the following values
change, then Cargo will reinstall the package:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'The package version and source.
.RE

.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'The set of binary names installed.

.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'The target (\fB\-\-target\fR).
.RE
.sp
Installing with \fB\-\-path\fR will always build and install, unless there are
conflicting binaries from another package. The \fB\-\-force\fR flag may be used to
force Cargo to always reinstall the package.
.sp
If the source is crates.io or \fB\-\-git\fR then by default the crate will be built
in a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target directory can be
specified by setting the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fR environment variable to a relative
path. In particular, this can be useful for caching build artifacts on
continuous integration systems.
.sp
By default, the \fBCargo.lock\fR file that is included with the package will be
ignored. This means that Cargo will recompute which versions of dependencies
to use, possibly using newer versions that have been released since the
package was published. The \fB\-\-locked\fR flag can be used to force Cargo to use
the packaged \fBCargo.lock\fR file if it is available. This may be useful for
ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact same set of dependencies that
were available when the package was published. It may also be useful if a
newer version of a dependency is published that no longer builds on your
system, or has other problems. The downside to using \fB\-\-locked\fR is that you
will not receive any fixes or updates to any dependency. Note that Cargo did
not start publishing \fBCargo.lock\fR files until version 1.37, which means
packages published with prior versions will not have a \fBCargo.lock\fR file
available.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Install Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-vers\fR \fIversion\fR, 
\fB\-\-version\fR \fIversion\fR
.RS 4
Specify a version to install. This may be a \fIversion
requirement\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying\-dependencies.md>, like \fB~1.2\fR, to have Cargo
select the newest version from the given requirement. If the version does not
have a requirement operator (such as \fB^\fR or \fB~\fR), then it must be in the form
\fIMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\fR, and will install exactly that version; it is \fInot\fR
treated as a caret requirement like Cargo dependencies are.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-git\fR \fIurl\fR
.RS 4
Git URL to install the specified crate from.
.RE

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-path\fR \fIpath\fR

Filesystem path to local crate to install.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-list\fR
.RS 4
List all installed packages and their versions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fR, 
\fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Force overwriting existing crates or binaries. This can be used if a package
has installed a binary with the same name as another package. This is also
useful if something has changed on the system that you want to rebuild with,
such as a newer version of \fBrustc\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-track\fR
.RS 4
By default, Cargo keeps track of the installed packages with a metadata file
stored in the installation root directory. This flag tells Cargo not to use or
create that file. With this flag, Cargo will refuse to overwrite any existing
files unless the \fB\-\-force\fR flag is used. This also disables Cargo's ability to
protect against multiple concurrent invocations of Cargo installing at the
same time.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fR \fIname\fR\&...
.RS 4
Install only the specified binary.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bins\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-example\fR \fIname\fR\&...
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-examples\fR

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-root\fR \fIdir\fR
.RS 4
Directory to install packages into.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-registry\fR \fIregistry\fR
.RS 4
Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in \fICargo config
files\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. If not specified, the default registry is used,
which is defined by the \fBregistry.default\fR config key which defaults to
\fBcrates\-io\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-index\fR \fIindex\fR
.RS 4
The URL of the registry index to use.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
The feature flags allow you to control the enabled features for the "current"
package. The "current" package is the package in the current directory, or the
one specified in \fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR\&. If running in the root of a virtual
workspace, then the default features are selected for all workspace members,
or all features if \fB\-\-all\-features\fR is specified.
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fR feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fR \fIfeatures\fR
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory's package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fR syntax. This flag may be
specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fR
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fR
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fR feature of the current directory's package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fR \fItriple\fR
.RS 4
Install for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fR\&. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fR for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode where the
target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See the
\fIbuild cache\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/guide/build\-cache.html> documentation for more details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fR environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. Defaults
to \fBtarget\fR in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Build with the \fBdev\fR profile instead the \fBrelease\fR profile.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fR, 
\fB\-\-locked\fR
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fR file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fR flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fR file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fR
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fR(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fR \fIN\fR, 
\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIN\fR
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\fBbuild.jobs\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fR, 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.

\fB+\fR\fItoolchain\fR
.RS 4
If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to \fBcargo\fR
begins with \fB+\fR, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such
as \fB+stable\fR or \fB+nightly\fR).
