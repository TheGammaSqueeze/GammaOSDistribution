/**
 * \file
 * \brief C API: Abstract Unicode Text API
 *
 * The Text Access API provides a means to allow text that is stored in alternative
 * formats to work with ICU services.  ICU normally operates on text that is
 * stored in UTF-16 format, in (UChar *) arrays for the C APIs or as type
 * UnicodeString for C++ APIs.
 *
 * ICU Text Access allows other formats, such as UTF-8 or non-contiguous
 * UTF-16 strings, to be placed in a UText wrapper and then passed to ICU services.
 *
 * There are three general classes of usage for UText:
 *
 *     Application Level Use.  This is the simplest usage - applications would
 *     use one of the utext_open() functions on their input text, and pass
 *     the resulting UText to the desired ICU service.
 *
 *     Second is usage in ICU Services, such as break iteration, that will need to
 *     operate on input presented to them as a UText.  These implementations
 *     will need to use the iteration and related UText functions to gain
 *     access to the actual text.
 *
 *     The third class of UText users are "text providers."  These are the
 *     UText implementations for the various text storage formats.  An application
 *     or system with a unique text storage format can implement a set of
 *     UText provider functions for that format, which will then allow
 *     ICU services to operate on that format.
 *
 *
 * <em>Iterating over text</em>
 *
 * Here is sample code for a forward iteration over the contents of a UText
 *
 * \code
 *    UChar32  c;
 *    UText    *ut = whatever();
 *
 *    for (c=utext_next32From(ut, 0); c>=0; c=utext_next32(ut)) {
 *       // do whatever with the codepoint c here.
 *    }
 * \endcode
 *
 * And here is similar code to iterate in the reverse direction, from the end
 * of the text towards the beginning.
 *
 * \code
 *    UChar32  c;
 *    UText    *ut = whatever();
 *    int      textLength = utext_nativeLength(ut);
 *    for (c=utext_previous32From(ut, textLength); c>=0; c=utext_previous32(ut)) {
 *       // do whatever with the codepoint c here.
 *    }
 * \endcode
 *
 * <em>Characters and Indexing</em>
 *
 * Indexing into text by UText functions is nearly always in terms of the native
 * indexing of the underlying text storage.  The storage format could be UTF-8
 * or UTF-32, for example.  When coding to the UText access API, no assumptions
 * can be made regarding the size of characters, or how far an index
 * may move when iterating between characters.
 *
 * All indices supplied to UText functions are pinned to the length of the
 * text.  An out-of-bounds index is not considered to be an error, but is
 * adjusted to be in the range  0 <= index <= length of input text.
 *
 *
 * When an index position is returned from a UText function, it will be
 * a native index to the underlying text.  In the case of multi-unit characters,
 * it will  always refer to the first position of the character,
 * never to the interior.  This is essentially the same thing as saying that
 * a returned index will always point to a boundary between characters.
 *
 * When a native index is supplied to a UText function, all indices that
 * refer to any part of a multi-unit character representation are considered
 * to be equivalent.  In the case of multi-unit characters, an incoming index
 * will be logically normalized to refer to the start of the character.
 * 
 * It is possible to test whether a native index is on a code point boundary
 * by doing a utext_setNativeIndex() followed by a utext_getNativeIndex().
 * If the index is returned unchanged, it was on a code point boundary.  If
 * an adjusted index is returned, the original index referred to the
 * interior of a character.
 *
 * <em>Conventions for calling UText functions</em>
 *
 * Most UText access functions have as their first parameter a (UText *) pointer,
 * which specifies the UText to be used.  Unless otherwise noted, the
 * pointer must refer to a valid, open UText.  Attempting to
 * use a closed UText or passing a NULL pointer is a programming error and
 * will produce undefined results or NULL pointer exceptions.
 * 
 * The UText_Open family of functions can either open an existing (closed)
 * UText, or heap allocate a new UText.  Here is sample code for creating
 * a stack-allocated UText.
 *
 * \code
 *    char     *s = whatever();  // A utf-8 string 
 *    U_ErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 *    UText    ut = UTEXT_INITIALIZER;
 *    utext_openUTF8(ut, s, -1, &status);
 *    if (U_FAILURE(status)) {
 *        // error handling
 *    } else {
 *        // work with the UText
 *    }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Any existing UText passed to an open function _must_ have been initialized, 
 * either by the UTEXT_INITIALIZER, or by having been originally heap-allocated
 * by an open function.  Passing NULL will cause the open function to
 * heap-allocate and fully initialize a new UText.

/**
  *  Clone a UText.  This is much like opening a UText where the source text is itself
  *  another UText.
  *
  *  A deep clone will copy both the UText data structures and the underlying text.
  *  The original and cloned UText will operate completely independently; modifications
  *  made to the text in one will not affect the other.  Text providers are not
  *  required to support deep clones.  The user of clone() must check the status return
  *  and be prepared to handle failures.
  *
  *  The standard UText implementations for UTF8, UChar *, UnicodeString and
  *  Replaceable all support deep cloning.
  *
  *  The UText returned from a deep clone will be writable, assuming that the text
  *  provider is able to support writing, even if the source UText had been made
  *  non-writable by means of UText_freeze().
  *
  *  A shallow clone replicates only the UText data structures; it does not make
  *  a copy of the underlying text.  Shallow clones can be used as an efficient way to 
  *  have multiple iterators active in a single text string that is not being
  *  modified.
  *
  *  A shallow clone operation will not fail, barring truly exceptional conditions such
  *  as memory allocation failures.
  *
  *  Shallow UText clones should be avoided if the UText functions that modify the
  *  text are expected to be used, either on the original or the cloned UText.
  *  Any such modifications  can cause unpredictable behavior.  Read Only
  *  shallow clones provide some protection against errors of this type by
  *  disabling text modification via the cloned UText.
  *
  *  A shallow clone made with the readOnly parameter == false will preserve the 
  *  utext_isWritable() state of the source object.  Note, however, that
  *  write operations must be avoided while more than one UText exists that refer
  *  to the same underlying text.
  *
  *  A UText and its clone may be safely concurrently accessed by separate threads.
  *  This is true for read access only with shallow clones, and for both read and
  *  write access with deep clones.
  *  It is the responsibility of the Text Provider to ensure that this thread safety

  *  @param deep   true to request a deep clone, false for a shallow clone.
  *  @param readOnly true to request that the cloned UText have read only access to the

  *  @param status Errors are returned here.  For deep clones, U_UNSUPPORTED_ERROR
