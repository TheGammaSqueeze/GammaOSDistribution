# AndroidX (formerly known as Android Support) libraries have moved
`frameworks/support` is no longer part of the platform checkout. Android platform now uses prebuilts of AndroidX for everything. AndroidX is being developed as an unbundled project.

# Next steps
- For source-code for your IDE, please use `*-sources.jar`s in `prebuilts/sdk/current/androidx`
- To contribute, check out the AOSP ([onboarding guide](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev:docs/onboarding.md)).
- For internal contributions dependent on pre-release platforms, see go/androidx-dev.
