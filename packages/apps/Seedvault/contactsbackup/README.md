# Local Contacts Backup

A backup application that backs up local on-device contacts via the system's backup API.
This explicitly excludes contacts that are synced via sync accounts
such as [DAVx‚Åµ](https://www.davx5.com/).

## Permissions

* `android.permission.READ_CONTACTS` to back up local contacts.
* `android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS` to restore local contacts to the device.
