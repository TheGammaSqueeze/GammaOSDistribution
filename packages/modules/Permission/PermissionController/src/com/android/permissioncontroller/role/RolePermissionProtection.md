# Using role for permission protection

Since Android S, it is possible to use `role` as a protection flag for permission definitions. This
allows more fine-grained control over which apps may get certain permissions, instead of the
`signature` or `privileged` protection that allows any platform-signed or privileged app to obtain
the permission. This was previously achieved via role-like protection flags, e.g. `installer` and
`verifier`, but they are essentially roles with a poorer implementation, and each of them takes one
bit from the protection flags so that we will be running out of bits soon.

The following outlines how to add a new permission with the role protection flag.

## Add (or modify) the permission definition

Edit `frameworks/base/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml` to add your new permission:

```xml
<!-- The javadoc for your new permission. -->
<permission
    android:name="android.permission.YOUR_NEW_PERMISSION"
    android:protectionLevel="internal|role" />
```

The choice of `android:protectionLevel` depends on your actual situation/requirements. More
specifically:

- `internal|role`: This enforces that only role may grant this permission to apps, which is the
preferred protection if possible.
- `signature|role`: This allows platform-signed apps to get this permission in addition to role
grants.
- `<previous-protection-level>|role`: Adding the `role` protection flag while keeping the original
protection level of an existing permission may allow a smoother transition to role permission
protection.

## Add the role

Edit [roles.xml](../../../../../res/xml/roles.xml) to add your new role:

```xml
<role
    name="android.app.role.SYSTEM_YOUR_ROLE_NAME"
    defaultHolders="config_systemYourRoleName"
    exclusive="true"
    minSdkVersion="31"
    static="true"
    systemOnly="true"
    visible="false">
    <permissions>
        <permission name="android.permission.YOUR_NEW_PERMISSION" />
    </permissions>
</role>
```

The role is named with the `SYSTEM_` prefix to indicate that it is an invisible and system app only
role. The config resource `config_systemYourRoleName` will be added in the next step, and more
details about role are available in [Android Role for system developers](Role.md). The
`minSdkVersion` attribute should normally be set to the current SDK version, to avoid making the
role available on older platforms.

If you are writing a CTS test for an API protected by an `internal|role` permission, you probably
want to grant the permission to Shell as well. This can be achieved by adding the permission to the
`SYSTEM_SHELL` role in `roles.xml`.

## Add the default role holder config

Now that we have a role, we need to define a platform config resource to initialize it with your
desired package name so that it may obtain the permission.

Edit `frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml` to add your new config resource:

```xml
<string name="config_systemYourRoleName" translatable="false">your.package.name</string>
```

You may also leave the package name empty in platform and override in a device/vendor-specific
overlay.

Since role is modularized, we also need to make this config resource a system API for access by
role.

Edit `frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/public.xml` to expose the new config resource as a system
API:

```xml
<public-group type="string" first-id="0xXXXXXXXX">
    <!-- @hide @SystemApi -->
    <public name="config_systemYourRoleName" />
</public-group>
```

Then run `m update-api` to update the API text files.

## Upload the changes for review

Finally, upload the changes to Gerrit in one topic, then add the appropriate owners for review. Once
the changes are submitted, you will have a working role protected permission.
