 * {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_setOperandValueFromMemory}. An application
 * should typically create one shared memory object that contains every constant tensor
 * needed to define a model. {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_createFromFd} can be used to
 * create shared memory from a file handle.
 * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_createFromAHardwareBuffer} can be used to
 * create shared memory from an AHardwareBuffer handle.
 *
 * Memory objects can also be used to specify the input and output arguments of

 *

 * memory object must be aligned on a boundary of a byte size that is a multiple
 * of the element type byte size, e.g., a tensor with
 * {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32} type must be aligned on 4-byte boundary.
 *
 * It is the application's responsibility to ensure that there are no uses of
 * the memory after calling {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_free}. This includes

 * created using such a model, any execution object or burst object created
 * using such a compilation, or any execution which references this memory
 * because of a call to {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInputFromMemory} or
 * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOutputFromMemory}.
 *

 * Starting at NNAPI feature level 4, the application may request creation of device native memory
 * from {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc} to avoid potential memory copying and transformation

 *
 * To use:
 *   - Create a new memory descriptor by calling {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_create}.
 *   - Specify all of the intended input and output roles by calling
 *     {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addInputRole} and
 *     {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole}.
 *   - Optionally, specify the memory dimensions by calling
 *     {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_setDimensions}.
 *   - Complete the memory descriptor with {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish}.
 *   - Use the memory descriptor as many times as needed with
 *     {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_createFromDesc}.
 *   - Destroy the memory descriptor with {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_free}.
 *
 * A memory descriptor is completed by calling {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish}.
 * A memory descriptor is destroyed by calling {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_free}.
 *
 * A memory descriptor must not be modified once {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish}
 * has been called on it.
 *
 * It is the application's responsibility to make sure that only
 * one thread modifies a memory descriptor at a given time. It is however
 * safe for more than one thread to use the memory descriptor once
 * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish} has returned.
 *
 * It is also the application's responsibility to ensure that there are no other
 * uses of the memory descriptor after calling {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_free}.
 * It is however safe to continue using a {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory} object created
 * from the memory descriptor.
 *
 * Available since NNAPI feature level 4.
