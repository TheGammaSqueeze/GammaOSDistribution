     * Performs a synchronous execution on a prepared model.
     *
     * The execution is performed synchronously with respect to the caller. IPreparedModel::execute
     * must verify the inputs to the function are correct. If there is an error,
     * IPreparedModel::execute must immediately return {@link ErrorStatus::INVALID_ARGUMENT} as a
     * ExecutionError. If the inputs to the function are valid and there is no error,
     * IPreparedModel::execute must perform the execution, and must not return until the execution
     * is complete.

     * The caller must not change the content of any data object referenced by request (described by
     * the {@link DataLocation} of a {@link RequestArgument}) until IPreparedModel::execute returns.
     * IPreparedModel::execute must not change the content of any of the data objects corresponding
     * to request inputs.
     *
     * If the prepared model was prepared from a model wherein all tensor operands have fully
     * specified dimensions, and the inputs to the function are valid, and at execution time every
     * operation's input operands have legal values, then the execution should complete
     * successfully. There must be no failure unless the device itself is in a bad state.
     *
     * IPreparedModel::execute may be called with an optional deadline. If the execution is not
     * able to be completed before the provided deadline, the execution may be aborted, and either
     * {@link ErrorStatus::MISSED_DEADLINE_TRANSIENT} or {@link
     * ErrorStatus::MISSED_DEADLINE_PERSISTENT} may be returned as a ExecutionError.
     *
     * @param request The input and output information on which the prepared model is to be
     *     executed.
     * @param measure Specifies whether or not to measure duration of the execution.
     * @param deadline Optional time point. If provided, execute is expected to complete by this
     *     time point. If it is not able to be completed by the deadline, the execution may be
     *     aborted.
     * @param loopTimeoutDuration The maximum amount of time that should be spent executing a {@link
     *     OperationType::WHILE} operation. If a loop condition model does not output `false` within
     *     this duration, the execution must be aborted. If no loop timeout duration is provided,

     *       corresponds to the index of the output operand in the Request outputs vector.
