/**
 * IExecution describes a reusable execution with request and several other execution configurations
 * fixed. It is used to launch computations.
 *
 * IExecution manages a sequence of computations of the same prepared model with the same request
 * and configurations. An IExecution object is used to control a set of computation, and to preserve
 * resources between computations, enabling computations to have lower overhead. IExecution objects
 * enable some optimizations:
 * (1) An IExecution object can preserve resources between computations. For example, a driver can
 *     map a memory object when the IExecution object is created and cache the mapping for reuse in
 *     subsequent computations. Any cached resource can be released when the IExecution object is
 *     destroyed.
 * (2) An IExecution object may be used for at most one computation at a time. This enables any
 *     transient computation resources such as intermediate tensors to be allocated once when the
 *     IExecution object is created and freed when the IExecution object is destroyed.
 * (3) An IExecution object is created for a fixed request. This enables the implementation to apply
 *     request-specific optimizations. For example, an implementation can avoid request validation
 *     and conversions when the IExecution object is reused. An implementation may also choose to
 *     specialize the dynamic tensor shapes in a prepared model according to the request.
 *
 * This interface is thread-safe, and any class that implements this interface must be thread-safe.
