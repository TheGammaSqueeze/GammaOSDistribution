     * data, optimization on the model's graph, or compilation into the device's native binary
     * format. The model itself is not changed.
     *
     * Optionally, caching information may be provided for the driver to save the prepared model to
     * cache files for faster model compilation time when the same model preparation is requested in
     * the future. There are two types of cache file handles provided to the driver: model cache and
     * data cache. For more information on the two types of cache handles, refer to
     * IDevice::getNumberOfCacheFilesNeeded.
     *
     * The file descriptors must be opened with read and write permission. A file may have any size,

     * zero size before writing to that file. The file descriptors may be closed by the client once
     * the preparation has finished. The driver must dup a file descriptor if it wants to get access
     * to the cache file later.

     * lower priority executions, and may preempt or starve lower priority executions.

     *
     * Optionally, the driver may save the prepared model to cache during the preparation. Any error
     * that occurs when saving to cache must not affect the status of preparing the model. Even if
     * the input arguments related to the cache may be invalid, or the driver may fail to save to
     * cache, IDevice::prepareModel must finish preparing the model. The driver may choose not to
     * save to cache even if the caching information is provided and valid.
     *
     * The only information that may be unknown to the model at this stage is the shape of the
     * tensors, which may only be known at execution time. As such, some driver services may return
     * partially prepared models, where the prepared model may only be finished when it is paired

     *     aborted.
     * @param modelCache A vector of handles with each entry holding exactly one cache file
     *     descriptor for the security-sensitive cache. The length of the vector must either be 0
     *     indicating that caching information is not provided, or match numModelCache returned from

     *     IDevice::prepareModelFromCache.
