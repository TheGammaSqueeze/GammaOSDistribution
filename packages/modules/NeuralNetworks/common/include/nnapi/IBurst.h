/**
 * IBurst represents a burst execution object.
 *
 * Burst executions are a sequence of executions of the same prepared model that occur in rapid
 * succession, such as frames of a camera capture or successive audio samples. A burst object is
 * used to control a set of burst executions, and to preserve resources between executions, enabling
 * executions to have lower overhead. Burst objects enable some optimizations:
 * (1) A burst object is created before a sequence of executions, and freed when the sequence has
 *     ended. Because of this, the lifetime of the burst object hints to a driver how long it should
 *     remain in a high performance state.
 * (2) A burst object can preserve resources between executions. For example, a driver can map a
 *     memory object on the first execution and cache the mapping in the burst object for reuse in
 *     subsequent executions. Any cached resource can be released when the burst object is destroyed
 *     or when the NNAPI runtime notifies the burst object that the resource is no longer required.
 * (3) A burst object may be used for at most one execution at a time. This enables any transient
 *     execution resources such as intermediate tensors to be allocated once when the burst object
 *     is created and freed when the burst object is destroyed.
 *
 * This interface is thread-safe, and any class that implements this interface must be thread-safe.

     *       time. outputShapes must have the same number of elements as the number of model output
