ExtServices module
=============================

### Introduction
ExtServices is an updatable Mainline module that contains the logic used by Android framework
components such as storage cache, autofill, textclassifier, package watchdog, notifications and
notification ranking that run continually. For the new features or bug fixes of these platform
defined services above or a new added platform service, it will provide more flexibility and
benefits by updating ExtServices in a more frequent cycle than a platform release cycle.
