/**
 * A log buffer manager that platform code can use to buffer logs when the host
 * is not available and then send them off when the host becomes available. Uses
 * the LogBuffer API to buffer the logs in memory.
 *
 * The manager uses two LogBuffer objects to handle flushing logs to the host at
 * the same time as handling more incoming logs. Incoming logs are always put
 * into the primary buffer first. The secondary buffer takes all the logs
 * currently in the primary buffer before the logs are sent off to the host
 * because the secondary buffer is the memory location passed to the
 * HostLink::sendLogs API. Logs are also flushed to the secondary buffer from
 * the primary buffer when the primary buffer fills up.
 *
 * When implementing this class in platform code. Use the singleton defined
 * after this class and pass logs to the log or logVa methods. Initialize the
 * singleton before using it. Call the onLogsSentToHost callback immediately
 * after sending logs to the host.
