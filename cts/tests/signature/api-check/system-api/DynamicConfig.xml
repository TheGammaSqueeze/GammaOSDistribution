        <!--
         ! Each value in this section identifies an expected failure and is of the
         ! form:
         !    <failure-type>:<signature of class/member>
         !
         ! These entries are loaded by AnnotationTest which uses them to construct
         ! an ExpectedFailuresFilter which discards them.
         !
         ! e.g. If the test fails with the following error message:
         ! repackaged.junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:
         ! extra_class:	android.media.MediaParceledListSlice	Error: Class annotated with android.annotation.SystemApi does not exist in the documented API
         ! extra_class:	android.media.MediaFrameworkInitializer	Error: Class annotated with android.annotation.SystemApi does not exist in the documented API
         ! extra_interface:	android.media.MediaCommunicationManager$SessionCallback	Error: Class annotated with android.annotation.SystemApi does not exist in the documented API
         ! extra_class:	android.media.MediaTranscodingManager	Error: Class annotated with android.annotation.SystemApi does not exist in the documented API
         ! ClassLoader hierarchy
         !
         ! The first step is to check that the extra classes are expected (e.g.
         ! because they have been annotated with the @SystemApi since this version
         ! of the CTS tests were released and the tests are being run on an
         ! Android system with a version of the mainline modules that includes
         ! those changes.
         !
         ! If they are not expected then this must be caused by a partner
         ! inadvertently adding something to the @SystemApi so the correct
         ! response is for them to stop doing that.
         !
         ! If they are expected then additional entries should be added to this
         ! section. That simply requires copying each error message into their own
         ! <value></value> element and then removing the whitespace after the
         ! first : and also removing the trailing " Error: ..." part (including
         ! the leading white space).
         !
         ! See below for some examples.
